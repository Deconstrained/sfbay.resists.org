#### Attacking and defending portals

* XMPs get much more powerful as you level.  The curve is such that L1-4s are pretty weak while L7s and (especially) L8s
  are extremely powerful.

* The damage cause by an XMP is strongest at the center.  At low levels, stand right on top of the resonator you are 
  attacking to maximize your damage.  Around level 4 or 5, the increasing blast radius of your weapons will make it more
  efficient to stand right on top of the portal and attack all resonators at the same time.

* The direction of the resonator depends only on which resonator slot you are filling, but the distance between you and
  the portal determines how far out the resonator will be placed.  Try to place resonators as far as possible from the
  portal, especially if this puts them into buildings, up hillsides, or in other difficult-to-reach places.

* You can charge an attack for up to +20% damage by holding down the fire button and releasing it when the pulsing cicle
  is at the center.

* Shields and links both provide damage mitigation to a portal.

* When you attack a portal, the portal will attack back, reducing your available XM.  Turrets increase the frequency of
  this happening.  Force AMPs increase the damage that a portal does to your XM.

* Mods cannot be removed except by destruction by the other team.  Each player can only place two per portal.  Think
  carefully about whether you want defensive mods (shields, turrets, and force amps), hacking mods (heat sinks and
  multi-hacks), or almost-always-useless mods (link amps).

* If you are at a portal under attack, try to keep deploying resonators as they get destroyed.  This is called 
  deploy-defending and is a great way to earn AP.

#### Gaining AP

* The first resonator and the last resonator placed on a portal are worth the most AP.

* You only get half AP for upgrading somebody else's resonator and none for upgrading your own resonator.  High level
  players will often only place a single resonator so a lower level player can later get maximum AP for the other 7
  placements.  Don't hesitate to fill up friendly portals!

* Because low level (1-4) XMPs are weak, most of your AP will come from deploying resonators and mods, linking, and
  fielding.  Once you start using L5 XMPs, destroying will start to become a steady source of AP.

* All links and fields are worth the same AP.  Because links cannot cross, this means that it's worth more AP to make many
  small fields than one huge one.

* Although links cannot cross, you can make fields overlap.  If you want to use a link for more than two fields (one on
  each side), you'll want to [learn](http://youtu.be/rkugS47h0j8) [hyperlinking](http://youtu.be/priezq6Dm4Y).

#### Communication

* There are two separate channels in the scanner: All COMM and Faction COMM.  The former is visible to all players, while
  the latter one is only visible to your team.  The Faction COMM is considered to be insecure as some players create a
  second account on the opposite faction.  (Don't do this -- it's against the official [Community 
  Guidelines](https://support.google.com/ingress/answer/2808360).)

* You can [send a message to a specific player] (https://support.google.com/ingress/answer/3096792?hl=en&ref_topic=3261456)
  by including @name in your message.  These messages are still visible to either all players or to your entire faction,
  depending on which channel you are using.  If you're sending messages to a player on the opposite faction, you need to
  use All COMM.

* Because of the insecurity of Faction COMM, most communication happens through other channels, including G+ Communities,
  Hangouts, PTT applications, and other tools.  We highly recommend connecting with your teammates through one of these
  methods.  See [our list of communities](/) to find one that covers your area.

* There's a lot of smack talk on All COMM.  Many players just ignore this channel completely  You can also [block
  specific agents](https://support.google.com/ingress/answer/4382615?hl=en&ref_topic=3261456) if somebody is being
  particularly annoying.

#### Teamwork

* At low levels, you can play the game successfully solo.  As you level up, the number of resonators that each player
  can place on a portal is limited.  You can place up to 8 L1-2 resonators, 4 each of L3-4 resonators, 2 each of L5-6
  resonators, and only 1 each of L7-8 resonators.  So, building a level 7 portal will take 3 level 8 players or 8
  level 7 players (or some mix of each).

* High level teammates are often happy to share their low level gear.  Speak up if you're running low on resonators and
  keys!  They can also perform "airstrikes" by quickly wiping out an enemy area with high level XMPs.  This will let you
  concentrate on filling and fielding the area instead of trying to take it out with low level XMPs.  Both the [G+
  communities](/) and local hangouts are great places to ask for this help.

#### Other

* Use the [official intel map](https://www.ingress.com/intel) for planning.
