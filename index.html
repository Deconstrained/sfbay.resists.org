    This page serves as a directory and gateway to the various Bay Area Resistance communities.  These
    communities are private, so you'll need to request an invite to join.  The individual communities
    are responsible for managing the invitation and vetting process.

  <h2>Other Methods of Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you need help and are unable to connect with us through one of the above communities, try reaching
    out on Faction COMM, although you should be aware that Faction COMM is considered to be insecure and
    no sensitive information will or should be shared there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several agents also have email addresses for fielding questions from players and connecting them with
    the community.  If you prefer connecting via email, you can definitely ask on Faction COMM for somebody
    to contact.
